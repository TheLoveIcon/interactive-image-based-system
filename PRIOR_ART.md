## Public Prior Art Statement

This repository documents the earliest public disclosure of an **Interactive Image-Based Digital Interaction System**.

The system enables interactive functionality embedded directly within a digital image or visual invitation. When a recipient interacts with specific visual elements (such as text, icons, dates, locations, or regions within the image), the system dynamically triggers one or more supported actions without requiring external buttons or separate user interfaces.

This repository includes:
- Conceptual description of the system
- Supported interaction types and actions
- High-level technical mechanism
- Intended use cases and extensibility

This disclosure is published for the purpose of establishing public prior art and documenting the original concept, structure, and scope of the system as of the repository publication date.
